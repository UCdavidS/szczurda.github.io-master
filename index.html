<a id="About Me." class="anchor" href="#About me." aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me.</h3>
<p>My name is David Szczur, and I am currently in my final year of a Computer Science degree at the University of Cincinnati. I developed a love for code when I took my first computer science course in high school, and I continued on to take AP CS the next year. After receiving a 5 on the AP test, I knew I wanted to become a software developer.</p>
<p>In addition to the rigorous curriculum at UC, I have also spent three entire semesters as a software developer co-op. This has allowed me to gain invaluable insight into the industry before graduation, and I know this will springboard my future career.</p>
<p>My current interests include building CI/CD pipelines, using tools like Docker, Jenkins, and Gitlab CI. I am also interested in utilizing Docker in a microservice architecture. I am most comfortable with Java development, but am currently learning abut functional programming and verification in my spare time!</p>

<h5>Siemens PLM - Content Tools and Delivery</h5>
<h6>Jan 2018 - Present</h6>
<p>The main goal of the CTD team is to deliver internal and  customer facing documentation. My first major project here was developing a content pipeline to continuously build and deploy content written by our authors.  Jenkins was used as our build tool, and I created a custom docker image of Jenkins that meant our requirements to build content. I wrote groovy scripts which automated the configuration of Jenkins, and used docker volumes to persist data. The Jenkins image was built and deployed using Gitlab CI.</p> 
<p>Other projects I worked on during this time were unit tests for XSLT, XSLT transformation scripts, and some HTML/CSS web pages.</p>

<h5>Siemens PLM - NX Drafting</h5>
<h6>May 2017 - Dec 2017</h6>
<p>I worked on the drafting team of NX, Siemenâ€™s advanced comprehensive CAD software. It was here that I learned much about automated testing techniques, as well as debugging failing attests. Some of these involved handling sensitive customer data, so I learned proper procedures for exporting protected data. I also learned much about the modeling and drafting applications of NX, and how engineers around the world use our software to create incredible things.</p>
<p>My biggest contribution to the team was a reworking of an internal debug timer. I changed the functionality to record per-view timings, as opposed to per-sheet timings. This allowed the tool to be far more effective in diagnosing customer submitted issues regarding performance. I also refactored the code behind this tool to make it more effective and extendable. The main technologies I used were C/C++ and Perforce SCM.</p>
